<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>I spent this past summer in my hometown of Durham, North Carolina 
volunteering at the Museum of Durham History during which I learned more
 about Durham than I had in over a decade of living there. While at the 
museum, I conducted research and wrote content for the “Tell Us What We 
Left Out” exhibit, took photos and videos to market another current 
exhibit, and interacted with museum visitors on a regular basis. The 
“Tell Us What We Left Out” exhibit features sticky notes which visitors 
use to submit topics they want to learn more about, research is done on 
the topic, then the write-up and laminated note are displayed 
side-by-side in the exhibit space. I used the research and writing 
skills acquired through my coursework in the humanities and discovered 
firsthand the power of having museum visitors drive the narrative and 
content of their local museum. &nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Over the summer, I worked in Burma with filmmakers I met while 
studying abroad in Prague (including one Burmese) to capture the 
compelling narratives of Burmese female construction workers who were 
physically developing what has been until recently one of the most 
isolated nations in the world. As Director and Executive Producer of <em>The Construct; Female Laborers and the Fight for Equality</em>,&nbsp;I
 handled fundraising, daily logistics, and interviewing subjects. This 
difficult but extremely rewarding project brought together theories and 
skills from my two majors, CAMS and Political Science.&nbsp; I learned 
on the ground how to communicate, coordinate, and ultimately get the 
shots we needed—and also learned the many difficulties of documenting 
(and gaining access to) other people’s lives.&nbsp; I look forward to 
continuing to work with international filmmakers on documentary films 
that tell the stories of women and girls around the world. <strong></strong></p>

<p><span>Over the summer, I was fortunate to experience what it is like 
to be up-close and personal in a film production company in Rome.&nbsp; 
KitchenFilm is an independent company, whose founder, Emanuela Piovano, 
has been directing and producing films since the 1980s in her hometown 
Torino, the birthplace of Italian cinema. My duties as an intern were 
always plentiful and at KitchenFilm they entrusted me with a lot of 
responsibilities, such as: translating into English documents or 
interviews conducted in Italian, cataloging books into a filer system, 
analyzing films they have produced, and exploring effective marketing 
strategies for their film.&nbsp; What is special about this company is 
its dedication to making women the central focus of their work. The 
world of cinema is a male oriented field, thus they have made it their 
mission to promote women in the film industry This was an amazing 
experience which I highly recommend!</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, through the Wellesley English Department internship 
program, I interned at W. W. Norton &amp; Company, the largest and 
oldest independent and employee-owned publishing company in the U.S. I 
had the privilege to work full-time with the Norton Anthologies as an 
editorial assistant on the College Department Literature Team. Immersing
 myself in the details of anthology publication, from editing tables of 
contents and footnotes to handling permissions and copyright, I learned 
about the diverse tasks that go into compiling anthologies, and 
ultimately about why anthologies tend to break the general rules of 
college textbook publishing. In this presentation, I hope to shed some 
light on this very specific niche of the publishing industry through my 
experiences with not only the immediate internship tasks, but also with 
the networking and intern collaboration that accompanied them.</p>

<p>Sacred space and modern tourism: the ideological evaluation of Saint Sauveur Cathedral</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>What relevance could medieval religion possibly have in the realm of 
modern tourism? Quite a lot, apparently, as I learned last summer during
 my internship as a student guide at Saint Sauveur Cathedral in 
Aix-en-Provence, France. As I gave guided tours of the fantastically 
preserved twelfth-century cloister and wrote a research paper on the 
fifth-century baptistery, which was constructed on the remains of a 
Roman forum, I was struck by the contrast between the ancient religious 
beliefs still practiced by many, which inspired the construction of 
these monuments, and the tourism industry, which views such buildings 
primarily as cultural collateral. Through my research and hands-on 
experience, I eventually came to see this juxtaposition as part of the 
continuation of a broader ideological paradigm that blurs the boundaries
 between the sacred and the profane.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>This summer, I lived in Paris and interned at IDFM Radio 
Enghien, a local radio station located just outside the capital in 
Enghien-les-Bains. I had the opportunity to give the news on air every 
day, in French, and during the month of July, I started a daily segment 
in English dedicated to less-touristy things to do in Paris for 
foreigners called “An American In Paris.” I was intrigued, and sometimes
 surprised, by the cultural differences apparent in France, both at work
 and during daily life in the city. This internship allowed me to 
experiment with a form of media that was new to me, and helped to 
strengthen my French skills. It also let me engage with Paris in a 
rewarding and engaging way, giving me a new perspective on the city.</span></p>

 summer I interned at Maven Pictures, a small independent film 
production company based in Lower Manhattan. My internship, which was 
sponsored by Wellesley’s English Department, focused on motion picture 
development and pre-production-- everything that needs to happen on a 
film project before the camera starts rolling, from revising the script 
to casting and preparing for shooting. As a Cinema and Media Studies 
major with a background in on-set film production, participating in this
 earlier stage of the filmmaking process was eye-opening and gave me a 
more well-rounded view of the independent film industry. It showed me 
firsthand that it is possible to change the film industry from within to
 improve diverse representation, and I hope that by coming to my 
presentation the Wellesley community can better understand the 
development and production processes of filmmaking and their impact on 
(as well as the impact of) society.</span></span></p>

 summer the Davis Museum Summer Internship allows Wellesley students to 
gain first-hand experience working in the field and meet museum 
professionals. The interns came from a variety of academic backgrounds 
and differing levels of experience with the Davis. Through our positions
 in various departments, we completed a diverse range of projects that 
included providing content for a new interactive app, planning upcoming 
exhibitions for the reinstallation, developing educational programming, 
helping to build the revamped Davis website, and much more. Weekly 
visits to New England museums and a week-long trip to New York City 
provided the interns with the chance to experience a variety of museum 
models and to develop the skills to critically assess their museum 
experiences. Audience engagement, whether through accessible labels or 
the use of technology, acted as a major recurring theme during the 
internship. Through the internship, we gathered around a common interest
 of making museums educational spaces where communities can come 
together and have fun in a welcoming environment. </span></span></p>

<p>What makes a book “good”? &nbsp;Are these the same qualities that 
make a book commercially successful? This summer I worked at Kneerim 
&amp; Williams Literary Agency in Boston. Through this experience, I 
explored a lesser-seen part of the publishing industry, one in which 
agents curate the pool of writing from which publishers choose, shaping 
and determining what kinds of content the general public will ultimately
 read. Agents must possess a refined but open palate, a strong awareness
 of the modern market, and a keen, perhaps even instinctual, sense of 
taste. Navigating an interesting boundary between upmarket (works of 
literary and scholarly merit) and trade (works with commercial appeal), 
agents must evaluate books not only as editors, but also as readers, 
lawyers, marketers and salespeople. In my presentation I hope to paint a
 portrait of this unusual and multifaceted side of publishing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>This summer, I had the privilege of interning with the Campaign
 for the Ayer Mansion. The Ayer Mansion is the only surviving 
residential commission by famed glass artist and designer Louis Comfort 
Tiffany. I researched the history of the house, its objects, and the 
Ayer Family that once called it home. I dove head-first into the process
 of historical preservation.&nbsp;Over the course of the summer, I 
traveled to various archives, met with scholars and art dealers, and 
pored over primary documents that were over a hundred years old. &nbsp;I
 discovered how it felt to be excited about the shape of a lamp, or the 
shade of a stone. As an art history major, I was able to appreciate the 
time, effort, and skill that go into ensuring art's longevity. &nbsp;</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>I hiked the French route of Camino de Santiago this summer. Hiking 
800 km from St. Jean Pied de Port to Santiago was a physically, mentally
 challenging experience. However, it was an opportunity to interact with
 people regardless their ages, professions, and ethnicities. Standards 
used to classify people in society meant nothing on the road. What 
matters the most to pilgrims -- people who are on the road -- was 
reaching Santiago. Although pilgrims had just met a new group of people 
on the road, they supported and encouraged each other merely because 
they share one common goal: arriving in Santiago. People on the Camino 
de Santiago are somewhat similar to people in Wellesley; both are 
diverse groups of people endeavoring to achieve their own goals. I hope 
my presentation encourages students to create a supportive environment 
in Wellesley where students are pilgrims who metaphorically hike to 
their own Santiago.</p>

 that all three of these objects, and almost two million more, belong to
 the non-profit preservation organization, Historic New England. 
&nbsp;Over the summer I interned through the McNeil Summer Internship

their collections facility. &nbsp;I worked &nbsp;directly with historic

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I used video and audio editing technology to help the 
Holocaust and Human Rights Center of Maine access testimonials and 
interviews of Maine residents who had lived through major human rights 
events. I created finished projects that will be accessible online for 
educational purposes. While focusing on two major interviews with a 
woman who grew up in Nazi Germany and a woman who participated in the 
Freedom Rides in Memphis during the Civil Rights Movement, I gained 
technical skills that will carry me forward into my studies in American 
storytelling. As I listened to first-person accounts of these historical
 events, I began to ask myself questions about the value of anecdotal 
stories, whose stories are considered valuable, and what biases we 
reinforce with the stories we choose to broadcast.&nbsp;</p>

 this September, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the 
Transgender Studies Conference at the University of Arizona. While this 
conference was interdisciplinary, I went with the explicit goal of 
learning more about transgender performance. Being able to watch and 
interact with other transgender performing artists was an experience 
that perfectly captured the intersection between my Theater Studies 
major, my Women's and Gender Studies major, and my personal experiences.
 In addition to the performance-related parts of the conference, I 
learned about recent theoretical explorations of transgender embodiments
 and methodologies. This conference provided me with critical tools to 
help me explore and contextualize my experiences as a transgender 
theater artist. I hope that I can share my learnings from this 
conference and provide “best practices” recommendations for ways that 
Wellesley and Boston theaters can work more closely and more sensitively
 with transgender theater artists.</span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, through the support of Wellesley-in-Washington, I was 
the Archaeology Collection Intern in the Anthropology Department, 
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. In addition
 to a range of daily collection management tasks, I conducted research 
to expand and improve catalog records for the ancient Mediterranean 
material. Working directly with classical antiquities, as I did at the 
Smithsonian, is a goal for my academic and professional life after 
Wellesley.</p>
<p>My Tanner presentation will cover: Wellesley-in-Washington, interning
 at a major (federal) museum, and my research project. My research 
project was focused primarily on oil lamps, which were ubiquitous from 
the Bronze Age to Late Antiquity. The demand for artificial lighting and
 the subsequent development of lamp types&nbsp; reveals much about the 
concerns, economies, religion, etc., that made up daily life.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Often, it isn’t until one is removed from one’s present environment 
that one recognizes the value of a unique experience. As we discovered 
ourselves, Wellesley students begin to appreciate the value of their 
unique college tenure once away from campus. This past year, we built 
upon what we learned at Wellesley by immersing ourselves in the 
different cultures of England, Italy, and France. In doing so, we took 
away a common theme of open-mindedness. Our presentation will focus on 
the Wellesley experience and how that prepared us for our time abroad, 
shaped our lives once there, and how that experience impacted our return
 to campus. Having an open mind enriches one’s experience in a foreign 
environment, permitting oneself to immerse in the lightness of discovery
 and learning. We learned to value our short time abroad and hope that 
our experiences encourage you to value your time and relationships at 
Wellesley.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Through comics (<em>bande dessinée</em>), a genre beloved by the 
French, female authors have questioned and resisted the idea of a 
singular feminine experience and the stereotype of the French woman. 
While studying abroad in Aix, I examined how female graphic novelists 
(Marjane Satrapi, Gally, Chloé Cruchaudet)&nbsp;in particular have 
expanded the mainstream conception of what it means to be a woman in 
France, encouraging understanding and tolerance. This study led me to 
discover comics as my own medium of personal expression. Both visual and
 literary, comics offered me the opportunity to communicate at a time 
when I struggled to articulate myself emotionally and intellectually and
 through my cartoon blog I was able&nbsp;to connect to my Wellesley 
community while abroad.&nbsp;I hope to leave the audience with a more 
complex understanding of comics’ potential to relay an emotional, 
social, or political reality to the reader.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every day of my summer internship in 
MoMA’s Collection Management and Exhibition Registration department was 
an exercise in professional development. My main objective was to 
understand the department’s role in the museum, and to gain experience 
working with registrars. Despite being an “invisible” department to 
outsiders, it is crucial to the operation of any museum. By speaking 
with co-workers, I was able to gain a greater understanding of art world
 politics and build on my previous experience working for the Davis 
registrars. I know my summer internship will be useful in my remaining 
time at Wellesley, and I am building my schedule to include courses and 
activities that will help me become a registrar in the future. Through 
my presentation, I hope that people will learn about the diversity of 
careers in the art world, and understand the importance of museum 
registrars to the visibility and stewardship of art worldwide.</span></p>

<p><span>This past summer I was a research assistant and translator for 
the New York Times, working directly with the former Paris bureau chief 
and contributing writer for the Times, Elaine Sciolino.&nbsp; In this 
position I gained insights into international journalism, research and

with archivists, museum curators and library specialists across Europe

networking.&nbsp; As a French major at Wellesley with a desire to pursue
 a related career, my time and experiences this summer allowed me to 
broaden and strengthen my linguistic skills, understanding of french

other cultures, and linguist enthusiasts to travel and live abroad to 
enrich their traditional academic experiences.</span></p>

 summer we interned at the Lobkowicz Palace, a museum at the edge of 
Prague’s palace complex and privately owned by the Lobkowicz family. The
 prominent family has been known in the Czech Republic for over 700 
years for their music patronage and art collecting.&nbsp; In the 20th 
century they were forced into exile by the Nazis, and then their 
property was confiscated by the Communist regime after WW II. Since the 
restitution of the several castles and collections in the 1990s, the 
Lobkowicz treasures have become a cultural fixture in the Czech 
Republic. Yet, visitors to the Lobkowicz Palace see only a small part of
 all that the dedicated staff do to make the vast collection publicly 
accessible. Departments collaborate behind the scenes to preserve 
artworks, fundraise for exhibitions, and breathe life into the 
Collections. We worked with the small staff to pursue projects varying 
from creating a Lobkowicz coloring book to documenting objects for a 
pictorial inventory. In doing so, we explored a museum’s unseen labor in
 bringing art to life today and for generations to come.</span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I interned at City Weekend, a lifestyle and 
entertainment magazine geared towards expats living in Beijing, China. 
As an intern, I was given free range to roam about China’s capital 
looking for story ideas and writing about the places and people I 
encountered. What I was not expecting to find on these jaunts, however, 
was a new level of self-confidence and comfort within my own skin. In a 
city where the average woman is 5’3 and Chinese, I quickly learned to 
accept my foreignness and how to proudly hold my head high. During this 
period of personal emotional, intellectual, and physical growth, the 
magazine I worked at similarly underwent a modern restructuring of its 
own. In a time of change and uncertainty, I learned the value of staying
 true to myself half a world away from home.</p>

<p>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Advertising's Role In Our World</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>In my first year at Wellesley, I studied the effects of advertising 
on women and society in my WGST 101 class. I listened as Jean Kilbourne 
famously pointed out in her documentary series "Killing Us Softly" that 
"Ads sell more than products ... To a great extent they tell us who we 
are and who we should be," and I critiqued the ads in my magazines. Yet,
 when I spent this past summer interning at TBWA\Worldwide, a leading 
advertising agency in New York City, I was struck by how different 
advertising was in the workplace: the way agencies struggle with their 
responsibility and power in culture, the complications that come from 
working with clients, and the role that the individual consumer plays in
 advertising. This presentation will discuss the little-known sides of 
advertising, the challenges agencies must face, and the way each and 
every one of us can shape our culture.</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>I took my independent study to Iceland this summer, where I traveled 
the country photographing a self-portrait series. The photographs 
explore themes of mental illness, family, sexuality, and identity. I 
will discuss the genesis of the project and how it grew from an idea to a
 rigorous shoot with props and multiple locations. Photographing in 
Iceland presents many benefits and challenges, which I navigated 
technically as an artist while handling the creative process of 
emotionally charged work. I will also discuss how collaboration with 
other photographers and working with family influenced my project.</p>

<p>During my year abroad in Japan, I was a part of a group that helped 
organize a series of feminist talks. The talks took place in a small 
community space and were open to the whole public. We decided to call 
our seminar, Feminism for everyone or <em>????????</em>. From these 
discussions I was able to engage with not only the local Japanese 
community but also foreigners living in the area. Each discussion had a 
theme based on feminism; from defining feminism to women and politics, 
we discussed the ways in which feminism can exist in all aspects of our 
lives. The most interesting for me was really learning about the 
environment of feminism in Japan—often called a man’s country.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This past summer I interned with the Center for Survivor Agency and 
Justice, a non-profit organization that works to remove systemic 
barriers faced by survivors of domestic violence through civil legal 
advocacy. Through my experiences with CSAJ I developed a deeper 
understanding of how the theoretical and academic call for 
intersectionality travels to advocacy institutions, the work they do, 
and the workplaces they create. CSAJ’s work is grounded in an approach 
of survivor centered economic advocacy, which places emphasis on the 
survivor’s lived experiences and the links between poverty and domestic 
violence. The scholarly orientation at the founding of CSAJ and its 
translation to their advocacy work and office environment provides an 
interesting case study for how the self-aware, intersectional community 
found at Wellesley can be created beyond “the bubble”.&nbsp;</p>

Intervention to de-escalate children. The Riverside intern observed a 
range of group therapies and assisted coordinators with the planning and
 leading of the therapeutic sessions. The interns learned how to apply

<p dir="ltr"><span>As a Nepali-American Seattleite, I love hiking, 
backpacking and experiencing mountainous bliss. My WellesleyServes! 
internship at The Wilderness Inner-city Leadership Development (WILD) 
program in Seattle’s Chinatown transformed my perspective of the 
outdoors. My summer experience has shown me the impact the outdoors can 
have on empowering youth of color and their communities. WILD is a 
one-of-a-kind environmental justice and outdoor leadership program 
mentored by people of color for predominately low-income, Asian Pacific 
Islander (API) immigrant and refugee youth. Typically, youth outdoor 
programs often result in youths’ isolation of the two places, the 
outdoors and home/community. I challenged the traditional framework by 
teaching my “Exploring a Sense of Place” curriculum and mapping 
activities (inspired by Marcy Thomas’ writing course). Throughout the 
summer, I supported the youth on their unique journeys to mentally and 
emotionally connect their experiences as environmental stewards in 
Washington’s outdoors and youth leaders in their local Chinatown 
community. </span></p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>Aldea Yanapay was founded twelve years ago to address Per</span><span>ú</span><span>’s stringent education system and widespread domestic violence. By providing a “conscient education” (</span><em>educación consciente</em><span>) based on the values of love, tolerance, and respect, Aldea presents </span><em>una otra forma de vivir</em><span>,
 or a different way of life, one that directly combats the violence 
children encounter at home and in school. Originally, I imagined 
teaching at Aldea Yanapay would involve me standing at the front of a 
classroom, delivering curriculum to students seated in desks. However, 
because Yanapay promotes an emotional and spiritual focus and the 
development of the whole person, its unique brand of conscient education
 is achieved through art, dance, music, and cultural exchange. As a 
volunteer at the organization, I witnessed how love can transform a 
community, and learned how to empower youth through conscient education 
to help them reach their full life potential and affect sustainable 
grassroots change.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>This summer we engaged in a variety of classroom 
settings--from working with low income preschoolers and adults in 
Berkeley, California, to developing and implementing curricula for 
students in Kampala, Uganda. Despite our geographic divide, each of us 
gained a contextual understanding of the role of education in a national
 framework. We worked with students who were only months old, adults 
returning to school or starting for the first time, and everyone in 
between. Along the way, we came to understand the ways in which 
education can serve as an equalizer and function as a stark indicator of
 difference. While we encountered an array of socioeconomic disparities 
this summer, we also recognized the ways in which our sites reproduced 
structural inequalities. This presentation will highlight the 
similarities and differences between public and private funding, 
teaching in classrooms versus one-on-one instruction, and our 
experiences in the United States and abroad. </span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>During my summer internship at Health Care For All, a Boston-based 
health advocacy organization for improving healthcare in Massachusetts, I
 created a story bank by conducting phone interviews with residents 
throughout the state. Historically stories about daily hardships have 
been used to help pass state laws to improve quality and access to 
healthcare. For instance, a story about the woman in Cambridge who 
rationed her asthma medication because her co-pay was not affordable is 
more powerful to help ?pass a law&nbsp;to decrease prescription drug 
costs&nbsp;than only quantitative data&nbsp;about the costs. I learned 
that public policy in addition to medicine helps individuals achieve 
better health through advocacy efforts from the grassroots level to the 
State House.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I worked closely with three inspirational women at the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in San José, Costa Rica. The
 two main projects I helped with centered on gender equality, one each 
in the private and public sectors. I supported UNDP’s collaborative 
project with INAMU (the National Institute of Women) in their Gender 
Equality Seal program, which aims to promote gender equality and women’s
 economic empowerment in the workplace. The second project’s goal is 
helping the 20 women in Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly work together 
and pass two law reforms and an amendment related to gender equality and
 women’s rights. Through my research and the events I attended with the 
public sector I learned of the need for a gender mainstreaming approach 
in development projects, all the while witnessing the free spirited 
‘Pura Vida’ culture of the Ticos very much present within the UN-House 
in San José.</p>

 summer, I interned with the Maine People's Alliance in Portland, where I
 worked on their Fair Wage Maine Campaign. Question 4, on the ballot in 
November, will gradually raise Maine's minimum wage from $7.50 to $12 by
 2020, and the subminimum wage for tipped workers from $3.75 to $12 by 
2024. We hear a lot about the wage gap, and in Maine, the majority of 
minimum wage workers are women. My experience this summer exposed me to 
the breadth of people in dire need of a wage increase. In particular, 
through organizing in a state where manufacturing jobs are rapidly 
declining and the service industry is the largest employer, I realized 
the need for a higher minimum wage for an economically viable future, 
and one in which women can survive and prosper.</span></span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>The focus of my internships was to understand the Syrian refugee crisis by immersing<br>myself in the refugee community in Istanbul, Turkey. My decision to work in Istanbul was<br>twofold: (1) I wanted to further enrich my study abroad experience when I conducted research at<br>the AlZaatri<br>refugee camp in Amman, Jordan? and (2) I wanted to apply the research I<br>conducted and the solutions I found during the Albright Institute on the challenges of providing<br>quality education to refugees.<br>My greatest takeaway from this experience was the humanitarian community’s lack of<br>foresight in its identification of and aid to vulnerable refugee groups. Though women, children,<br>survivors of violence, people with physical or mental disabilities, and ethnic minorities<br>traditionally constitute the bulk of vulnerable persons during wars and crises, the lack of<br>humanitarian attention to single men ages 1835<br>in this crisis has proven detrimental for their<br>integration and empowerment in their host countries.<br>This presentation will seek to unravel the hidden tensions in the Syrian refugee crisis, the<br>humanitarian and international community’s response, or lack thereof, to these tensions, and my<br>project at Small Projects Istanbul that served to empower a lost generation.</p>

<p><span>Our Wellesley education emphasizes the importance of tackling 
barriers facing women.&nbsp; After arriving in South Africa for our 
internship at SCORE, an organization dedicated to improving the lives of
 children through sport, we were struck by gaps between programs for 
boys and girls.&nbsp; While boys dominated the soccer and rugby 
programs, girls found themselves relegated to watching them play.&nbsp; 
We quickly realized that gender inequality was an enormous problem in 
the community.&nbsp; As interns, we introduced our favourite sports, 
basketball and hockey, and found that these unfamiliar “gender-neutral” 
activities served as a common ground between boys and girls, as well as 
Afrikaans- and Xhosa-speaking children.&nbsp; We also organized “Women’s
 Week,” during which we highlighted a different women’s issue each 
day.&nbsp; In this presentation, we discuss what we learned from 
listening to the needs of girls in the community and the power we 
discovered in the language of sports.</span></p>

 has the world’s largest burden of tuberculosis and the disease is its 
leading public health problem. This summer we worked at Operation ASHA, 
an NGO based in New Delhi that works to end this infectious disease that
 is curable with antibiotics. We learned about their pipeline approach 
to delivering the government-sponsored medicines to the doorsteps of 
their patients in urban vs. rural settings. Furthermore, we had the 
opportunity to interview the only XXDR-TB or extremely drug-resistant TB
 patient OpASHA has completely cured; although TB free her family has no
 source of income for sustaining themselves in the future. Towards the 
end, we worked on redesigning their website by editing and restructuring
 content and adding graphics, videos, and patient stories. We hope to 
take this experience forward to promote TB awareness at Wellesley this 
year. By attending our presentation, we hope you learn how socioeconomic
 status can affect public health.</span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Autism spectrum disorder affects approximately 1% of the world 
population and is the fastest-growing developmental disability in the 
U.S. Patients with ASD display a range of behavioral symptoms, including
 hyperaggression. Aggression is not unique to humans; mice also display 
this innate social behavior. However, the precise neural circuits 
controlling aggression are not yet fully defined. My summer research in 
the Feng lab at MIT utilized the genetic approach of a mouse model with a
 mutated form of <em>PTCHD1</em>, a gene that has been associated with 
ASD and hyperaggression, to gain insight into aggression circuitry. I 
will discuss our behavioral experiments, which tested the response of 
mice to intruder mice, and our results that show inhibitory circuitry is
 mediating aggression in <em>PTCHD1</em> mice. This experience furthered
 my interest in pursuing neurobiology research after Wellesley, while 
reminding me that the critical thinking skills Wellesley emphasizes are 
fundamental to the success of research.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This past summer, I participated in the Global Engagement Program to 
work at ACPACYS, Asociación Cordobesa de Parálisis Cerebral y Afecciones
 Similares, a non-profit organization in Cordoba, Spain that aims to 
empower people with cerebral palsy. I worked individually with students 
in classrooms on their tasks, built interpersonal relationships with the
 residents, and facilitated daily activities at the center. As a student
 intern, I shamelessly asked for help, acknowledged and overcame the 
language barrier (especially improving my Spanish) and gained confidence
 in my pursuit of the empowerment of marginalized communities. But more 
importantly, the experience taught me that in every wheelchair is a 
mother, a jewelry-maker, or a former French professor, each with his/her
 own story. I learned to differentiate ignorance from discrimination and
 to be a friend before being a worker. The compassionate embrace of the 
community and the rewards of genuine interactions truly gifted me an 
unforgettable summer.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Plagued by political turmoil and economic instability, Guatemala has the 4<sup>th</sup>
 highest rate of chronic malnutrition for children in the world. The 
effects of malnutrition have devastated the country’s indigenous 
population which has endured relentless persecution and crippling 
poverty. This summer, I interned with Mayan Families, a non-profit 
organization that seeks to empower the indigenous Mayan communities. 
Through collaboration, I helped implement various programs to provide 
nutritious meals, vitamins and medical resources for chronically 
malnourished children and their families. Working with the families gave
 me a deeper understanding of the challenges of dealing with 
malnutrition when coupled with a lack of access to&nbsp;economic 
security, education and basic needs like water and shelter. My summer 
experience was invaluable as it inspired me to explore how I can 
mitigate the health disparities facing indigenous communities and 
contemplate my future goals in global health.</p>

<p>Noted as one of the most beautiful islands in the world, Palawan has 
become a hot tourist destination. Many, however, are unaware that local 
Palaweños suffer from serious health problems including high rates of 
maternal death, teenage pregnancy and HIV infection. This summer, I 
interned at Roots of Health (ROH), a NGO, committed to empowering women 
by providing free clinical services and sexual education on the island. I
 learned how the intersection of culture, religion and politics 
contributed to the island’s health landscape and what is being done to 
transform old attitudes and behaviors. Concepts that I have learned in 
the classroom became lived experiences. For instance, I witnessed the 
tensions between the indigenous health system and biomedicine, and the 
creativity that accompanies improvised medicine. I will share 
experiences and stories from my interactions, providing a glimpse into 
their resiliency, hope and spirit as they look toward a brighter future.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I explored how I could use my interest in Computer 
Science to solve social problems at home in Kenya. Throughout the 
process of developing an app to improve the accessibility of healthcare,
 I uncovered the intersections of poverty and healthcare problems. In 
most of the rural neighborhoods outside the major cities, there were 
establishments with physicians practing without standard or credible 
oversight. At these establishments there were long lines of patitents 
without other options waiting to be treated. I learned that many of 
these physicians were apprehensive about introducing our app at their 
practices, likely due to fear of exposure of their unsafe practices. 
This is only one of the many challenges we encountered which 
simultaneously demosntrated the great need for our app, which would help
 every patient locate and access credible health facilities near them. I
 have only begun to uncover the positive impact technology can make, and
 I am positive that a lot more can be done at home. I am eager to 
continue learning the difference I can make utilizing technology.</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Over the course of this summer, I conducted microbiology research at 
the Universidad Católica de Córdoba (UCC) in Córdoba, Argentina. I 
investigated the antimicrobial resistance of <em>salmonella</em> on 
fresh pork sausage from the province of Córdoba, Argentina. 
Antimicrobial resistance can happen anywhere in the production chain. 
This is extremely important to public health because there are no 
regulations in the pig and pork production chain in Argentina. This 
experience was significant because I learned how much science 
intertwines with politics when thinking about public health policies, 
especially in developing countries. I was fortunate to be under the 
mentorship of Dr. Juan Pablo Vico and other faculty of UCC. Their 
genuine interest in helping me definitely reminded me of the faculty 
here at Wellesley. Finally, I hope my presentation shows my audience 
what it is to conduct scientific research abroad and the WHO concept of 
One Health.</p>

<p><span>This research experience with the Boston Children's Hospital 
Division of Newborn Medicine provided me with insights into the process

primary stages and&nbsp;organizational aspects of classifying and 
preparing large sets of brain MRI data for analysis while requiring a 
strong understanding of previous research and findings. This experience 
fostered in me a deeper understanding of the spectrum of human research,
 both retrospective and clinical, and allowed for reflection on the 
impact of such research on current and future generations of children 
and families. In preparing for a career in medicine, this internship 
offered the opportunity to more deeply&nbsp;reflect on pediatrics in a 
larger context as well as understanding the many levels of involvement 
at all stages of healthcare</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I spent this summer in an immunology lab,

 response to measure immune strength and how learning more about HIVs

 maternity ward is an extraordinary place, where women give birth to 
infants that have the ability to become parents themselves. However, a 
hospital’s women’s department is more than maternity, and in reality may
 address aspects of women’s health from menstruation, menopause, 
endometriosis and mental health. Over the summer, I studied women’s 
health through a biological lens at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, 
United Kingdom. Through a combined experience in clinical observation 
and data analysis, I explored what it means to “be a woman,” and how our
 bodies operate at a personal baseline unique to us all. In this 
context, I came to a greater understanding of pregnancy and women’s 
health issues. For any woman, the state of “normal” is subjective, and 
in health care specifically I have learned that it is the culmination of
 inherent features </span><em>and</em><span> life events that make us each a little different. </span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Understanding how a region’s cultural and religious

of obstetrics and gynecology. Last winter, I traveled to Doha, Qatar for
 four months to work in Labor &amp; Delivery and Trauma as a volunteer 
Remote EMT. This transformative experience highlighted stark cultural 
differences in how the Qatari healthcare system approaches the care of 
female patients as compared to my observations of women’s healthcare 
within the United States. These variations are widespread and include 
delivery room visitation, female/male patient segregation, genital 
mutilation, child marriage, domestic abuse, sacrifice of quality for 
modesty, family dynamics, and religious approaches to grief counseling 
and important medical decisions. Developing a sensitivity to and 
knowledge of the history of these cultural nuances can result in more

<p dir="ltr"><span>I spent my summer internship at <em>Health Care For All</em>.
 Working in the oral health team, I worked in a project that addresses 
why dental care access is low for MassHealth members. Through my summer 
internship, I realized how dental care in America is truly a privilege 
for those who can afford it. The systemic and persistent barriers that 
the underserved populations in our society face are immense. Although 
one might argue that state insured Medicaid programs have allowed 
low-income adults to have dental coverage, it is worth noting that 
dental access due to provider shortage, limited providers participating 
in Medicaid, and psycho-social determinants of health all impose 
significant barriers and exacerbate care-seeking behaviors for those 
individuals. This internship has give me a clearer understanding of why 
patients’ oral health needs are unmet and urged me to dedicate my 
passion to help those who are less advantaged as a future dental 
practitioner.</span></p>

<p>I worked with a physician specializing in degenerative brain diseases

investigating the cognitive and emotional impact of reductions in 
dopaminergic medication following deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's 
patients. I was able to observe surgeries, sit in on cognitive 
evaluations, and analyze patient data. Working with real patients whose 
lives I could realistically better with my research was an incredibly 
valuable experience, as well as seeing all the collaboration and 
expertise that is involved in patient care. The kindness and 
consideration that the physicians showed for their patients’ needs on 
both a physical and emotional level was inspiring, and I hope to 
continue to be a part of such meaningful work. From this presentation, I
 hope that everyone listening will learn all that doctors do to provide 
the best care possible, both inside the surgery room and out of 
it.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>My off campus experience focused on the psychosocial health of the 
LGBT community, specifically lesbians and gay men over fifty, and how 
their stress levels and maladaptive coping mechanisms related to their 
emotional well-being. My research really taught me the importance of 
looking at groups individually as opposed to one homogenous whole. For 
example, looking at men vs. women or looking at sexual minorities vs. 
heterosexuals. I am interested in health, and this project has given me 
experience in researching and measuring health, and some of the 
difficulties associated with that. I hope that those who attend this 
presentation will learn that the LGBT community is very diverse and 
should be studied as such. They experience different stressors and cope 
differently compared to their heterosexual counterparts, and it is 
important to take that into account in research.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, six Wellesley students conducted research in pediatric 
and adult hematology/oncology at Boston Children’s Hospital and 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. As aspiring women in medicine, we enjoyed 
the opportunity of expanding our understanding of contemporary medicine 
by conducting translational and clinical research, attending seminars 
and rounds in the Longwood Medical Area, and shadowing clinicians. 
Furthermore, in response to the dearth of women in academic medicine, we
 hosted weekly lunches with female physicians who contributed to our 
understanding of the importance of research, compassionate care, and 
education in the increasingly evidenced-based world of medicine. In 
studying rare diseases and their impacts on patients, we contributed to a
 crucial body of work that will improve therapies for diseases that 
affect populations worldwide, and we are excited to share all we have 
learned about academic medicine, clinical care, and the future of 
medicine.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Primary cilia are hair-like projections of centrioles that extend 
from eukaryotic, mammalian cells. The diverse functions of primary cilia
 include sensory regulators as well as signal transducers in many 
signaling pathways, most notably in Sonic Hedgehog Pathway that promotes
 neurodevelopment (Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014). Mutations in eukaryotic 
cells that produce phenotypically altered primary cilia result in 
ciliopathies that give rise to various cognitive disorders, including 
Joubert's Syndrome and Meckel-Gruber’s Syndrome (Guemez-Gamboa et al., 
2014). However, there are many unknown genes in primary cilia that could
 be the cause of these syndromes. Genes encoding G-coupled protein 
receptors embedded in primary cilia play an important role in Shh 
pathway, specifically <em>Gpr161</em>(Mukhopadhyay and Rohatgi, 2014). <em>Gpr16</em>1
 is investigated in a gene knockout experiment in efforts to observe 
changes in cilia morphology using immunochemistry and electron 
microscopy that could give rise to cognitive disorders from causing 
disruption in the Shh pathway. &nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I participated in a clinical research internship program.
 I worked on one study examining the relationship between narcotics, 
congestive heart failure and readmission, and another looking at patient
 perceptions of physician attire. By working with my preceptor, I 
realized it is possible to practice medicine while still doing 
meaningful research. As an AMST and Chemistry double major, I worry that
 choosing one path means closing off the other. However, this summer I 
saw how my science courses allowed me to understand the mechanics while 
my humanities background made me an effective communicator. I learned 
that while not everyone will view your research as worthwhile having the
 ability to form a cohesive argument goes a long way. I hope that in 
viewing my presentation people will see the value of understanding the 
social, economic, racial, and gendered inequalities in our world no 
matter what field they choose.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>If medicine belongs to the sciences and human rights to law, where 
does Physicians for Human Rights fit as an NGO? Existing somewhere 
between Doctors Without Borders and Human Rights Watch, Physicians for 
Human Rights’ program on Sexual Violence in Conflict Zones straddles 
this gap. They do so by identifying best practices in policing, 
medicine, and law during the course of investigations into sexual 
violence, and then increasing state accountability for meeting those 
standards. During this presentation, I will explore some of the methods 
used to identify those best practices and get states on board with 
enforcing them in East Africa, specifically in Kenya and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo. These tools include the unsurprising: UN conventions,
 sensitivity training, to the unconventional…a cellphone app? I will 
consider these tools from the perspective of an intern who did 
everything from pack thermometers to write security protocols during her
 three months with PHR.</p>

<p>“What do you want to be when you grow up?” This is a question all of 
us have undoubtedly struggled to answer at different stages of life. 
Deciding what to do after you leave the safe enclaves of college often 
seems like an insurmountable task, yet everyone does it.&nbsp;This 
summer, I shadowed a neurologist at the Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia (CHOP) and screened patients for studies focusing on rare 
neurological diseases.&nbsp; In my spare time, I spoke with many 
Wellesley alumnae to hear how they traversed their career paths. 
Reflecting on insights from alumnae, in addition to experiencing 
clinical and research work in a hospital setting, helped me clarify my 
passion for medicine and personal career plans after graduation.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Not only is the heart the first organ to “form and function” during 
development, but it is responsible for distributing the oxygen and 
nutrients necessary for survival. Scientists and doctors alike, however,
 are curious: what makes the development of such a critical organ 
possible? For the past two summers, I interned in Dr. William Pu’s Lab 
at the Department of Cardiology at Boston Children’s Hospital, working 
alongside a postdoctoral researcher exploring mitochondria’s role in 
heart development. Through performing experiments, analyzing data, 
presenting research and shadowing doctors, I not only broadened lab 
skills but engaged firsthand with the many sides of translational and 
clinical research. I look forward to speaking more about my project, as 
well as about some important lessons I learned: that before you can cure
 a heart disease, you have to better understand how a healthy heart 
forms, and that good research depends on a good question.</p>

another side of healthcare — a department closely attuned to the 
psychosocial needs of patients and not just the diagnosis and treatment 
of their illnesses. We worked with patients one-on-one in order to 
specifically address their educational, emotional, and social needs. 
Some of our most valuable experiences came from learning to soothe 
frightened and anxious patients with simple play therapy, witnessing the
 strong rapport between the Child Life specialists and the patients in 
their care, and sharing in parents’ relief that their child could 
experience joy in a hospital environment. </span></p>

work in the Special Olympics East Asia office based in Shanghai. There I
 worked closely with its Healthy Athletes (HA) department. HA trains 
medical professionals and provides free health screenings to athletes at
 SO sponsored events with the hopes of closing the health disparities 
that people with intellectual disabilities face. My internship powerful

<p>Even though striosomes, a specialized subset of striatal neurons, 
were discovered almost four decades ago, their function remains largely 
unknown. I spent my summer in Dr. Ann Graybiel’s neuroscience lab at 
MIT, working to uncover more of this striosome mystery as it pertains to
 Huntington’s Disease using model mice. I trained these mice to perform 
behavioral tasks, managed a breeding colony to help establish lines of 
“birthdating” mice, and used embryonic time points to tag developing 
striosomes. I was able to use the collaborative skills from my Wellesley
 education to propose and defend ideas to a team of research scientists,
 and my experience solidified basic neuroscience research as a definite 
career path. This presentation will focus on how striosomes play a part 
in cost-benefit decision-making, and will propose potential connections 
between mood, motivation, and Huntington’s Disease.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>As biological data sets continue to grow 
exponentially, computational approaches to understand them have become 
increasingly important. As a student who is deeply interested in the 
intersection of computer science and biological sciences, I spent the 
summer designing a library of 3’ untranslated regions--non-coding 
sequences within a gene that play a major role in regulating gene 
expression--in order to gain a better understanding of the quantitative 
effects of unknown regulatory elements in our genome. At my internship, I
 gained a newfound sense of confidence in conducting research 
independently and a deeper appreciation for computing power in biology. 
Moreover, this experience showed me how I could meaningfully merge the 
many interests I have developed thus far at Wellesley. I hope that those
 who attend will also be intrigued by the immense possibilities that 
result from bridging disciplines and understand the necessity of 
advocating for the materialization of your ideas in research.</span></p>

<p>This summer, I had the privilege of working at the Boston Children’s

 solving problems on my own as they (unexpectedly!) came up. Over the 
summer, I came to critically consider the many different facets of 
research, and the many different methodologies involved in tackling a 
specific, scientific problem. I learned that collaboration, effective 
communication, and thoughtfulness in the lab helps to foster the 
productivity, and even success, of research. In this presentation, I 
hope to share with you the impactful medical applications of the 
research I did. My experiences have honed skills that I hope will foster
 growth as a researcher, and prove useful in my aspiration to become a

I spent much of my time in a primary health center commonly called “olomowewe,” which roughly translates to “child health center” in Yoruba. While olomowewe was unusual for most primary health centers in the country due to its affiliation with a major university, the reality of being in a resource-limited setting still greatly impacted the quality of care available. Despite this, many factors allowed the clinic to better manage the challenges of a lack of resources in ways I, as an outsider, did and did not expect. This experience further enhanced my desire for a career related to health care in resource limited settings.</span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: arial; color: #000000; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br></span></span></div>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>During the spring 2016 semester, I participated in the Medical Practice and Policy program in the Danish Institute for Study Abroad (DIS) in Cophenhagen, Denmark. As a student preparing to apply to medical school, I selected this program because I am interested in the differences between the health care systems of the United States and Denmark. In particular, I wanted to learn more about the goal to provide equal access to free health care for all Danish citizens, &nbsp;the hallmark of the Danish health care system. Through volunteer work in nursing homes both in Denmark and the United States, I have been able to compare how the values of each country are reflected in their respective health services. Through courses, field trips and out-of-classroom experiences, I have come to see our country's health care in a new perspective, which is undoubtedly valuable to my growth as a future contributor to the medical field.</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>In Oakland, California, health advocates are using food to ameliorate poverty-linked diseases such as diabetes and obesity—and are simultaneously demonstrating the need for interdisciplinary work in medicine, politics, and economics. Supervisor Wilma Chan (’71) and researchers at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital are implementing a program to improve the health of pre-diabetic, food insecure children and their families. The program, called Food As Medicine, provides participants with fresh produce and cooking classes to increase access to healthy foods and influence the families’ eating habits. &nbsp;As a part of this effort, I used my public health and economics background to research similar food intervention programs. My conversations with doctors, health activists, and government officials taught me that improving public health is complex, but Food As Medicine is a testament to how poverty-plagued communities can create innovative, sustainable solutions.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>Many believe that radio is dying and slowly being replaced by television, the Internet, and other technologies. Many also believe that the same can be said for journalism. This summer, I explored both of these supposedly dying media through my internship at KPFA, the first community-powered radio station in the country, located in Berkeley, CA. I worked as a field reporter for a statewide evening news broadcast, </span><span>collecting audio and conducting interviews at community protests, meetings, and other newsworthy events in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though I worked closely with the directors of KPFA News, my work was mostly independent, as I was responsible for writing, voicing, and producing my own daily stories in a fast-paced, exciting newsroom. In my presentation, I will explain how being a reporter is harder - and cooler - than it looks, emphasizing how radio and journalism are capable of empowering and engaging communities everywhere.</span></p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This summer I interned at a think tank called Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai through Wellesley’s Global Engagement Program. Having travelled to India a few times before, I was able to expand upon my immersive experiences so far by living in the city and working for a local organization. While taking the role of graphic designer and gaining experience with producing cohesive designs for an organization, I learned about ORF’s various initiatives across different areas of development, including education, urban planning, health, and international relations. From contributing to the initiation of an India-China Studies Center, to designing a poster in a language I don’t understand, my work ended up requiring me to draw from various facets of my identity and academic interests. This truly multidisciplinary experience demonstrated the importance of a diversified knowledge set while working in global development, as a designer, and in international settings.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This past spring semester I studied at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. During these five months, I took engaging courses that provided opportunities and perspectives not available to me at Wellesley. Attending a large urban university initially seemed like a contradictory experience to the Wellesley Bubble, but in truth there were many similarities. Through on-campus participation in clubs and purposefully maintaining an active social life off-campus, I cultivated new dynamic relationships with students and professors. Bonding between students took place over meals and drinks, at university festivals, and on weekend trips. Although I had difficulties adjusting to language and culture differences at first, ultimately this academic and personal learning experience enhanced my view of the world and my place in it.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This summer, I was a consulting intern performing consumer research in Shanghai, China through the Luce Internship Program. My experience became my first real step into the business world, a world entirely different from the Wellesley community. I had to navigate a new office culture, adjust to a bustling city culture, and try to grasp Chinese interpersonal culture. Using my language skills, I was able to make sense of nuances behind the local interpersonal culture. Through my understanding of cultural nuances, I learned how to navigate an intercultural work environment in a foreign city. My academic and social experiences at Wellesley gave me the skills necessary to navigate and analyze my new experiences, and ultimately take a stand and try to improve communication within the company. I hope those who attend my presentation will learn how to effectively navigate and grasp foreign cultures to serve as a liaison.</span></p>

This past summer, I participated in Break Away, a program that has confirmed for me the meaning and value of service and has empowered me to grow as a leader and as a student. A first-year service trip experience inspired me to pursue an Environmental Studies major. Service intersected with my academic pursuits again this past summer when I investigated how the Nez Perce tribe worked to preserve their native culture and practices in the face of social and environmental injustices that affect their reservation. Going to new places and learning about and serving alongside communities different from my own has been an integral part of my liberal arts education, and I hope to show attendees that they can often learn more from other people than they ever could on their own.</span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>While studying at DIS in Copenhagen last spring, I enrolled in a course about migration. We discussed the plight of refugees, the strain on European resources, and the politics of life and death. I had no idea the impact it would have on my worldview, and on my academic life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through trips to refugee centers in Germany, community homes and aid stations in Denmark, and a land border crossing in Morocco, I witnessed firsthand aspects of the refugee experience. A conversation with a young woman who fled Syria deeply impacted me. I saw and spoke with the people behind the newsreels and political rhetoric. I saw the human cost of inaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am presenting today, not because I have all the answers, but because I want to share with you what I saw, and how it impacted me. I want the stories of those I’ve met to be heard. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>I spent this summer working to publicise the policies and effects of a multinational environmental agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). CMS was created to ensure that migratory animals can move across national borders and is a branch of the UN Environment Programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This internship was a window into the workings of UNEP, which has the potential for global reach but can lapse into lumbering bureaucracy. I understand better how multinational treaties function in practice, and the pros and cons of working at an international organization in a foreign country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spearheaded the communications for a meeting of the signatories to a CMS Agreement, including summarizing proposed policies and outlining their importance. I learned to organize a campaign, read policy, and write in a neutral but palatable way about political topics. I would like to share these discoveries in a Tanner presentation.</p>

<p>Navigating Dalian, China: My Study Abroad Experience</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>As an American and a representative of the Critical Language Scholarship Program, this summer I set out to form US-China connections with other individuals and learn the Chinese language. In Dalian, China I lived with my Chinese grandmother and auntie in a host family set up. I took rigorous language courses at Dalian University of Technology, and I was able to build on my language skills in an immersion setting. While learning about the language and culture was a large part of my experience, I also fell ill for a month out of the two that I was in China. It was then that I learned of the differences in the health care systems in China and the US. My experiences in China have allowed me to hone in on future career choices in the medical field where I can integrate my gained knowledge of Chinese language and culture. &nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Through Shining Future International Consulting, cultural exchanges are made through the education of the younger generation. Our cultural exchange began as being a summer councilor in New York City for middle and high school age Chinese students. Through the lessons we created and taught, as also through visiting cultural sites, we gave a snapshot of American culture to our Chinese students. After being councilors, we spent days with university Chinese students to understand the personal experiences of life through their eyes. Those days represented the coming together of our diverse cultures. The exchange was completed by our travel to Beijing where we stayed for two weeks. Without knowledge of the city or language, this time we were the ones receiving the snapshot of Chinese culture by receiving lessons and touring cultural sites. From teacher to student, New York to Beijing, and everything in between, this was our cultural exchange.&nbsp;</p>

Through interning at Renewal House, St. Francis House, and St. Stephen’s B-SAFE this past summer through the Lumpkin Summer Institute for Service Learning, we were afforded the opportunity to work directly with survivors of domestic violence, people experiencing homelessness or living in poverty, and low-income children from underserved schools in the Boston area. While each of these organizations has the larger mission of fighting oppression in these communities and beyond, it is the small, daily personal interactions with clients that make that goal a possibility. By working with these populations, we were challenged to reconsider traditional narratives about the experiences of marginalized people and to consider the role that systems of oppression play in shaping their potential.</span></span></p>

Policy-makers are alarmed at the burgeoning inequity, and are increasingly turning toward behavioral economics to help address issues of inequality. This presentation will focus on how insights from behavioral economics help explain some seemingly odd decisions that people make when voting on economic policy. Drawing on my economics background, I will discuss how altering the way we think about and measure economic inequality will allow policymakers to change perceptions of inequality across party lines, and thus create more effective redistributive policies. </span></p>

<div>I spent the summer in Monash Univeristy researching the question of epistemic injustice and practical interventions against it, as part of the Albright fellowship. In this presentation, I will consider the groundbreaking books of Miranda Fricker (<em>Epistemic Injustice,</em>&nbsp;2007) and José Medina (<em>The Epistemology of Resistance,&nbsp;</em>2012). I depart form the assumption that TRCs in post-colonial societies, such as South Africa, have epistemic goals, in addition to political and moral ones, and I will use their findings to challenge the belief that epistemic injustice is best considered through the lens of virtue ethics.</div>

The above groups belong to the Scheduled Tribes(STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs) in India. We each conducted original ethnographic research on topics dealing with identity and perception based on physical features in relation to beauty standards; discrepancies between waste-management protocols and the goal of sustainability; and discipline and parental engagement in education. After speaking with numerous members of the village, we came to recognize the complexity surrounding the intersections among various social stratifiers such as race, caste, religion, and gender. </span></span></p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While studying abroad in China, I conducted research on the Chinese media and its influence on public perception of nuclear relations between China, the United States, and the two Koreas. When I first came to China, I had difficulty in communicating with the locals to interview them about their own experiences and opinions. There was also an issue of trust: why would these locals trust me, a foreign stranger, with their opinions about the Chinese government and their thoughts on nuclear politics? Getting their trust and breaking through language barriers taught me a lot about conducting fieldwork in a foreign country, which is important for me, as a Political Science major. This experience nuanced the cultural and language barriers that I often read about in my textbooks. I hope that those who attend my presentation will learn how to overcome language barriers and connect with locals in a foreign country.</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Little is known about Sri Lanka in the Western world. For decades, other South Asian countries that maintain crucial political, diplomatic, and economic ties with the West have overshadowed an island burdened by ethnic conflict. This summer, I interned as an English teacher at Vincent Girls’ High School (VGHS) in the eastern town of Batticaloa to study the Sri Lankan education system and to also explore post-war development in the country. Much of what I learned about culture and development in Sri Lanka echoed themes of religion, family, and gender that I have studied in my South Asia Studies classes at Wellesley. Attendees of my presentation will learn more about the Sri Lankan education system and will also hear about identity and development in the nation after the end of the thirty-year civil war in 2009.&nbsp;</p>

<p>90mi away: Challenging American Perceptions of Cuba</p>
</td>

<td align="left" width="20%">
Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>The element of mystery that shrouds the country of Cuba drew me in to study there for two months. Before my arrival, I only knew the U.S propagandist view of Cuba: a socialist country with a dictator, and suffering people detached from the rest of the world. Through my unforgettable classes, experiences, and interactions with the Cuban people, I learned to view Cuba as a unique country with a complex identity. It is not only a beautiful Caribbean country with extremely amiable people, but also a country whose unique history and culture has had the power to strengthen the bonds while driving a divide among its people. The goal of this Tanner presentation is to share what I’ve learned to erode stereotypes of Cuba, and break the barrier between U.S. perception and Cuban reality.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>As a Global Engagement intern, I worked this summer at Observer Research Foundation Mumbai (ORF). &nbsp; ORF is a think tank which develops policy proposals in diverse issue areas, from sanitation to foreign policy.&nbsp; ORF <em>is</em> independent, yet well-funded through Reliance Foundation (RF)—the nonprofit arm of business behemoth Reliance Industries.&nbsp; ORF’s chairman is a retired politician who was heavily involved in the work of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, which has found legitimacy and power in today’s India. While contributing to a book RF commissioned our office to produce about RF’s disaster relief work, I encountered firsthand the webs of money and politics my coworkers navigated every day in their pursuit of change.&nbsp; The experience helped me analyze my own understandings of activism and the development industry in South Asia, both as an anthropology student focused on critical development studies and as someone drawn to, yet ambivalent about, development work.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While interning with Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN 5th District), one of the most striking observations I had was the abundance of attractive staffers who appeared to have just left the pages of a magazine. It was so notable, in fact, that I found myself gushing to a friend about how everyone seemed to be blessed with great genetics. “Of course,” she explained, “Politics is a social profession...human instinct naturally draws us toward attractive people, those people who hone their social skills have an advantage in politics.” As it happens, the Capitol offers far more than lessons in the legislative process; it’s an opportune place to develop people skills, confidence, and grasp the nuances of American politics. My internship offered unparalleled networking opportunities and insight into the complex legislative machine.</span></p>

<p>Unlike most students at Wellesley who study abroad for a semester, I chose to study abroad for a full year in London. Through my own observations and experiences, I will discuss the benefits and detriments of living abroad for a full year and making an impact in the local community. While abroad, I was able to fulfill my dream of trekking across Europe, during which I learned how to make connections in an unfamiliar environment, make the most of my experience while living on a tight budget and learn the impact that my gender had on my travels. I will examine the tradition of travel in Europe, focusing on transportation and the relationship between travel and gender. &nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>New Zealand has earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciers, tsunamis, and landslides. As a geosciences major and anthropology minor I am fascinated by how people learn about these events and prepare for them. I worked with the Dunedin City Council and researched natural hazard information and how cities decide to prepare for disasters. Everything changes in a second and the optimistic bias that convinces people that this just won’t happen to them prevents them from completing the small chores that could make a difference. I saw citizens appeal building codes to build their houses in tsunami and flood risk areas. A flood in Dunedin last June helped me compare a low socioeconomic community to the university’s preparedness. I discovered the importance demographics play in the receptivity and access to natural hazard information.&nbsp;I submitted my findings to Civil Defense and Emergency Management.</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This past summer, I worked at a small sheep dairy in upstate New York. As a farmhand, I was responsible for the physical daily care of the flocks, as well as the preparation of products leaving the business. It is very common to accept that food comes from farms without realizing the work that goes on beyond the storefront. Having been part of the sheep-milking and cheese-making process, I now have muscle memory of the labor put into farm animals and land, but also a deeper understanding of what it means to be “sustainable” and “farm-to-table.” As a biology major planning to work in the future with animals, this experience was vital to understanding today’s human-animal interactions. I think it’s important to learn that sometimes the most meaningful learning experiences occur outside the classroom and office, and that getting your hands dirty is a real aspect of the work field.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I interned at the Center for Gender and Sexuality at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India. My internship was a media research project looking at LGBT suicide as a structural problem in India. As part of my research, I looked at four important LGBT-related suicide cases and the community response that they garnered. I also explored the various laws in India that specifically seemed to target members of the LGBT community. This internship allowed me to discover the circumstances of the LGBT community in India. Since the queer identity is such a taboo topic in Indian society, I was unaware of how bad the conditions could actually get for people of sexual minorities, even though I am an international student from India. This experience opened my eyes to the pain and suffering of LGBT people in India that was hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>We know that the clothes we wear all have labels that tell us where our garments are manufactured, but how do we know if the garment is ethically manufactured? I grappled with this question for ten weeks at Social Accountability International (SAI), a labor NGO, which created the voluntary SA8000 standard to hold companies responsible for their supply chains and to regulate facility conditions. After 20 years, SAI’s role in corporate social responsibility (CSR) has evolved to include new programs and metrics built into SA8000.&nbsp; I worked with the Standards &amp; Impacts and Strategic Programs departments to measure the trends in Social Fingerprint, a new SA8000 requirement tool. I also worked on various projects involving the Living Wage Coalition, which helped me understand the changing scenery in the CSR field. This presentation summarizes my experience at SAI and evaluates the various methods used to hold facilities and companies accountable.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Interning at the CNDH exposed me to intricate settings: the governmental circuit of Morocco and the network of the UN’s National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs). Familiarizing myself with the protocol of the CNDH—an independent organization mandated by the UN yet funded by the Moroccan government—and the current human rights work in Morocco revealed a need for a slower pace of bureaucracy than expected. While my Moroccan colleagues explained leaps forward in family law, they also readily answered questions about its spotty enactment. They touted the right to free speech and assembly for citizens, yet asked me to summarize reports from the Freedom House underscoring weak points in the freedom of Moroccans. Duality seemed to serve as a go-between between the new generation and the old, and the result was a textual history denoting the stability of the country through tense situations both in and out of its borders.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I interned at Rogers Investment Advisors, a leading fund of hedge funds in Tokyo, Japan. In the ten weeks working at RIA, I gained a deeper understanding of the hedge fund industry in Asia, the interconnectedness of the world economy, and the Japanese corporate culture. My projects ranged from modeling investment portfolios, researching Chinese public pension funds and Asia Technology funds to preparing business documents for new venture capital firms. Before this internship, I had never been to Japan nor did I speak Japanese. However, having grown up in China and lived in Singapore, I knew how valuable global perspectives are and how important it is to learn about a country by living there. In this presentation, I will share a peek into daily life in a buy-side investment firm, and how my past experiences helped me navigate throughout one of the largest metropolitan cities in the world. &nbsp;</p>

At East Carolina University, we collected and analyzed data from the popular GitHub platform on users in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park to observe the growth of the local GitHub community over time.

At MIT’s Space Systems Lab, we programmed a satellite-building game for an international competition, and at Tufts, we built an independent interface for collaborative learning and discussion. The jump from classroom to research lab was a large one, but our experiences at Wellesley prepared us for the challenges we had to face.

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I was an intern at a social policy and applied psychology lab and was mainly involved with a project focusing on analyzing the efficacy of home intervention programs. The most edifying experience I had was learning about ethical practices in the lab. A significant portion of my role at the lab involved consenting protocol and retention efforts, which both provided direct exposure to IRB regulations and internal decisions the lab had made about how to operate in a just manner. I am excited for students to learn about the differences between reading about ethical procedures in a classroom, as I’ve done at Wellesley, and applying those in a lab with human subjects, especially as rules are challenging and blurry. I was lucky to work in a lab that took this as an opportunity to be as morally and scientifically rigorous as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A year ago, I doubt I would have ever heard the term “cleantech,” let alone known what it meant. All that changed, however, through an internship with the Cleantech Group, the owner of the term “cleantech” as a registered trademark and a leader within the cleantech industry. “Cleantech” refers to any technology that enables more efficient use of resources. Extending far beyond solar and wind companies, the cleantech industry also includes companies like Airbnb, the popular home-sharing service, because it increases efficient use of space and resources by reducing the number of hotels built. This summer taught me that business and technology can be a powerful force not only for innovation, but also for environmental impact, although that impact is more complicated than meets the eye. I look forward to sharing my excitement about this field with other Wellesley students and hope they consider cleantech as an avenue to engage their interests in business, technology, and the environment.</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I took Convex Optimization during the Summer Session at Stanford University, where I explore the use of mathematical optimization in real life. I found that abstract mathematical work like concepts in convex optimization could be used in surprisingly many fields like finance, physics, and biology. It can help people choose portfolios in finance market, determine the trajectory of a landing rocket, detect essential genes of a cell, and recover a signal with noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This learning experience makes me more interested in mathematical optimization and computer science. It turns the maths concepts I learned in the linear algebra class at Wellesley into a powerful tool for finding a mathematically provable optimal point. I hope people who attend my presentation will realize the power of this technique as I did and have a rough idea of how to express a real life problem in maths formulas and codes.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>On my summer internship with the University of Cincinnati Laboratory for Advanced Healthcare Technologies I worked with a team of Computer Engineers, Graphic artists, and ER doctors to design, implement, and test an IOS application that helps EMT’s to diagnose stroke. In addition to quantifying stroke severity, this innovative app uses geolocation to identify the most appropriate hospital for stroke treatment and facilitates Facetime communication with the treatment center. While I had a variety of experiences, ranging from learning 3-D human animation to App development in the Swift language, the most valuable experience was learning to work with a non-technical client. Beyond learning tactics for communicating across fields, the experience instilled in me a profound admiration of academic collaboration, and deeper understanding of what it means to be a diverse and effective team in an increasingly technical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The SeedKit is a low-cost lab-in-a-box used to teach hands-on science experiments in low-resource schools. This summer, deployed the SeedKit in five schools in the suburbs of Accra, Ghana. We worked with a Boston-based NGO, The Exploratory which runs after school science club for girls programs in Ghana. By establishing relationships with students and science teachers, we immersed ourselves in a new culture and learned how we will further adapt the SeedKit to match their needs. Here on campus, we worked on developing assessments and data analysis strategies that could be used to determine the efficacy of our project. Through the decision making process we started to understand the importance of cultural sensitivity when designing projects for other communities. We will provide insight into the challenges we faced as social entrepreneurs in the education sector, and the things we learned from various mentors in the Ghanaian and Wellesley communities.</span></span></p>

<p>Ancestral Astronomy: A spectral analysis of protoplanetary disks</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Often, peering into our own past requires looking outward – very, very far outward. Spectral analysis of protoplanetary disks – the disks of cold gas and dust that form infant solar systems – provides a snapshot of the structure and chemical composition of the disks as they evolve in time. Analysis of these disks helps us to understand how our own Solar System may have formed, and what features of it may be common or anomalous in the solar systems of the universe. Drawing heavily on my Wellesley astrophysics coursework, I conducted research analyzing absorption spectra of four protoplanetary disks using data from the Keck II telescope. I am excited to have had the opportunity to investigate our own origins – through systems light-years away.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p><span>In Peru, a large performance gap between private and public schools has led to a false belief that all private schools are inherently superior to public schools. Consequently, government officials have neglected the education system over the years and let the private sector play a larger role. The ultimate goal during my internship at GRADE was to debunk this myth and argue for more government support of education. I assisted my supervisor in preparing papers for government leaders regarding the national education policy, and started an analysis of the education system. I was able to hone my research skills, learn more about the Peruvian education system, and practice my communication skills. This experience also reaffirmed my hopes to pursue policymaking as a career path.</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Water scarcity and efficiency is often not on the minds of US citizens and residents. We think of water so loosely that we freeze it, just to place it again in our drinks. This past summer, I worked with INIDA and the University of Cape Verde on Santiago Island to examine how water is managed along with related development issues. By interacting directly with people in the city and countryside, I witnessed firsthand how different daily life is from that of developed countries. I observed conflicts and management decisions between communities, institutions, and governmental parties. Using design engineering principles, I delved deeper to find the root cause of clashes over water and technology, and I realized the increasing complexity in doing so. I was, thus, forced to change my perspective and approach. I now understand the impact of not only technology but also that of education and cultural norms.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I fulfilled my calling as an Idahoan by working for a potato company. I managed the social media accounts for the Innate® potato, a genetically modified potato developed by the J.R. Simplot Company. The Innate® potato was developed over the course of fifteen years to be bruising/browning resistant and to contain less acrylamide (a probable carcinogen) when fried at high temperatures. These traits allow for more sustainable potato production by reducing food waste. Many people believe that GMOs are bad, but aren’t sure why. As a result, the social media climate around GMOs is overwhelmingly negative, despite the scientific consensus that GM foods are safe. My presentation will explore the complicated nature of potato production and teach attendees about the consumer traits of Innate® potatoes, the prevalence of biotech crops in the food supply, and the strategies employed for successful social media management in a controversial industry. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Not&nbsp;to be Served but Serve: Volunteer Teaching Programs and Cultural Competency</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we serve a community that is not our own? National volunteer teaching programs, like AmeriCorps’s Reading Corp or Teach for America are often critiqued for relying on the White Savior Complex to recruit teachers. Drawing on my experience with AmeriCorps in Minneapolis, I examine the validity of this criticism but also the various opportunities to improve tutors’ cultural competency. Specifically, I will present my research about Native American education in Minneapolis. Based on interviews with Native American educators, I created a resource guide for tutors not familiar with the community, which addresses the historical trauma that resulted from the US public education system being used as a tool of oppression. &nbsp;My guide provides suggestions for culturally sensitive methodologies for volunteer teachers, and is an example of how volunteer teaching programs can be more inclusive.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a grass-roots fellowship, hosting thousands of meetings for recovering alcoholics. Each local chapter maintains their own website with a list of meetings, therefore there is no global AA meeting list. We purpose creating such a list by combining automated scraping, machine learning algorithms, and crowdsourcing where automated methods fail. Firstly, we scraped aa.org to obtain the urls of the local chapter sites. Next, we are scraping each local site to obtain all the urls listed, however this is proving to be very difficult. While we are working on perfecting the scraping code, we are also working on finding the best classification algorithm for determining whether a particular page contains a list of meetings. We are currently comparing a variety of machine learning algorithms for this task. For those pages in which our code is not able to produce high accuracy we will use crowdsourcing.</p>

<p>With the booming demand for photorealistic 3D models in virtual spaces to emulate the physical world, visually flawless content must be generated rapidly in a cost-efficient manner. By bringing together principles of physics, design, programming, mathematics, and the power of over 100 digital cameras, quality 3D content creation can be made accessible to anyone. I will be sharing my experience working with virtual reality at a startup in South Korea. Focus will be on my research on the physics of how hair, eyes, and skin are generated as 3D models, how computers can accurately render objects to mimic reality, and how such work is helping shape the state of animation, video games, and virtual reality.&nbsp;</p>

However, how important is working memory in mathematical reasoning, and are there specific groups of students who rely more on working memory than others? These were some of the questions that I explored at MIT’s Gabrieli Lab, a cognitive neuroscience lab where I have been exploring my interdisciplinary interests in neuroscience and education for the past year. This summer, I spent my time collecting and analyzing cognitive and neural data. Through this experience, I not only gained technical research skills, but I also learned the importance of conducting my research from the perspective of both a scientist and a teacher. In my presentation, I will talk about the interdisciplinary approach that I took to ask meaningful questions and share my findings that have practical implications.</span></span></p>

<p class="normal">After a three year renovation, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum reopened with a commitment to improving the visitor experience through technology. Visitors now receive a special stylus, the Pen, which allows them to “collect” objects to be viewed later online. The Pen gives both visitors and museum staff an abundance of information about how people interact with the collections. As this summer’s Peter A. Krueger intern in the Digital and Emerging Media Department I researched, developed, and implemented a new branch of the website, the Visit Statistics page. This page displays details of a visitor’s interaction with the Pen and augments Cooper Hewitt’s distinctive “post-visit experience” which extends the reach of the collection beyond the physical museum. This significant internship offers important connections, hands-on experience, and invaluable technological and design knowledge to students.</p>

<p>After spending a year abroad with the ECCO program in Bologna, Italy, I had the amazing opportunity to stay for the summer and conduct physics research. My research was on organic semiconducting materials, which can potentially be used in various medical devices. Yet my summer was not only science-focused: it was a perfect liberal arts experience in which I was able to enjoy cultural immersion in a country that values beauty in people, food, art, nature, and life. This experience was unforgettable for the three Fs of my title, friends, food and <em>fisica</em>; a perfect fusion of my two passions that taught me how science and humanities are not opposites but fields that nurture one another and are equally necessary for developing the human mind and heart.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>Schizophrenia affects up to 50 million people worldwide and new research is emerging to investigate this mental disorder. This summer I had the unique opportunity to work with the principal investigator of a new neuroradiology lab at the University of Wisconsin Hospital (UWH) that was largely in the preparatory stages for animal research in schizophrenia. My tasks ranged from researching vendors of rat diets to running animal behavioral tests. I became an effective consumer of scientific literature, as I compiled spreadsheets of Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 rat models and relevant behavioral testing paradigms. I also assisted the director of development in the Department of Surgery on a project for the non-profit group Cars Curing Kids. I helped organize their largest annual event where "graduated patients" of the American Family Children's Hospital cruise around Madison in cool cars. This experience enhanced my resourcefulness, collaboration, and research techniques as a neuroscience student.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p dir="ltr">This summer I interned as a Teaching Fellow at Breakthrough New York, a non-profit organization and college success program that focuses on providing resources to high potential, low income middle school students. I taught 7th grade science and art classes in the South Bronx, where I witnessed the effects of the achievement gap and the difficulties students faced when their families could not provide them with what they needed to succeed. This experience opened my eyes to see the increasing demand for academic and emotional support for students whose paths to college may be more challenging. I hope that my presentation will bring to light some of the struggles these students experience, while offering my peers a chance to reflect on their own journeys to Wellesley, and whether they bear marked similarities or differences to the obstacles that these middle school Bronx students face.</p>

<p>Only 9% of all computing-related occupations in 2015 were filled by women of color, according to the Bureau of Labor.&nbsp;This summer, I had the opportunity to join the 4% of African-American women web developers and intern at HubSpot, a start-up founded in 2006 that reached its IPO on the NYSE in 2014. During my overwhelmingly positive time at HubSpot, I was able to network with many people throughout the company; work on Hubspot.com, developing pages that received millions of views; and communicate directly with stakeholders. However, just as I am usually only one of a few African-American women in the Wellesley CS courses, I was the only African-American woman interning at HubSpot this summer. In my presentation, I would like to address the serious lack of women of color in the tech industry, and what companies like HubSpot can do to combat it.</p>

<p>My job this summer was to learn more about Bronze Age funerary practices by fearlessly delving into the blaze of the funeral pyre. &nbsp;No time machines or superpowers were necessary to accomplish this task—I instead read clues in the form of diagnostic fracture and warping patterns that appear on human bone during cremation.&nbsp; As a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates Fellow with the Bronze Age Körös Off-Tell Archaeology (BAKOTA) project, I analyzed cremated human remains from a Hungarian cemetery site with the goal of examining possible social structures within the population and determining how this population fit into the dynamic social and economic world of Bronze Age Central Europe.&nbsp; This incredible opportunity not only allowed me to work with students and archaeologists from around the world, but also provided me with the tools to pursue biological archaeology, an interest that I developed through anthropology coursework at Wellesley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>During my two summers at Goldman Sachs I worked in the Securities Sales &amp; Trading program. I worked in five different groups focusing on soft dollar accounts, cash equity research sales, hedge fund operations and clearing, structured cross asset sales, and prime brokerage sales and capital introduction services. Working at Goldman Sachs was an incredible opportunity to see how a major financial institution responds to worldwide events such as the Greece crisis, Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, the Olympics, terrorism in France, Brexit, and more. As a psychology major and a computer science minor entering Securities was daunting but I found that my two fields of study, though seemingly unrelated to finance, actually provided me with the diversity of thought that helped me succeed throughout my time. I hope that those who attend my presentation will understand more about the various opportunities at large banks and how to successfully pursue them.&nbsp;</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p class="p1">Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a popular way to learn, but they face high dropout. When users drop out, it is known as churning. The process of predicting churn in MOOCs can be applied to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Since it is more costly to obtain new customers in prepaid&nbsp;telecommunications services than to retain them, it is important to be able to pinpoint those who may churn. This research opportunity showed me how industrial research is done,&nbsp;specifically at Huawei Technologies, how to work with an international team, and serve as project manager. At Wellesley, there are many opportunities to engage in academic research, but it is difficult to find industry opportunities that focus on research, especially in international locations. I hope that my audience will learn that research is possible in industry, and the value of working with people from different cultures in international positions.</p>

<p>At ARI, I lived and worked on a farm alongside a diverse community of rural leaders from Asia and Africa training in sustainable agriculture and servant leadership. Their goal was to empower their communities with the knowledge to separate from an environmentally and economically unsustainable reliance on synthetic chemicals.&nbsp; While weeding rice paddies, earthing sweet potatoes, and making fertilizer from fermented chicken manure, I studied organic methods of farm management and pest control.&nbsp; In working, eating, and praying with grassroots leaders from around the world, I observed how leaders in poor communities prioritize, reflect, and make agricultural decisions.&nbsp; My view of “sustainable” agriculture has grown to be holistic—including everything from science-based technologies to economic viability to time management.&nbsp; Furthermore, in practicing servant leadership, I have gained greater insight into how to live the Wellesley College mission: <em>Non Ministrari sed Ministrare.</em></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I had the opportunity to intern at the Forensic Investigation Research Station (FIRS), more colloquially known as a body farm. One of only six in America and seven in the world, FIRS gave me a very hands-on experience in the research used to bring murderers to justice. Despite the necessity for definite evidence in a murder case, the knowledge needed to accurately determine how long a body has been out is surprisingly low, especially in scenarios involving different conditions. FIRS, located near Grand Junction, Colorado, helps fill these gaps by researching how the human body decays in a desert environment. In helping collect data for multiple projects, I gained insight in osteology, crime scene processing, and unexpectedly, photography. Smelly, morbid, and completely amazing, my internship was invaluable in showing how much still needs to be done in the forensic field.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>The growing field of behavioral economics differs from traditional economics by introducing a heavy dose of psychology. This past summer, I worked in a behavioral economics lab at Harvard Business School, investigating&nbsp;psychological mechanisms&nbsp;underlying human behavior. I helped with different experiments and gained experience of many research processes, including brainstorming ideas, reviewing literature, collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data. In addition, I also designed my own study, examining whether people show an aversion to complexity, and, if so whether that could explain the fact that some high-return, low-risk strategies or securities do not have a high demand in financial markets. The experience expanded my knowledge and academic understanding of both psychology and economics, and helped to inform me about potential future career paths. I am eager to share my experience of conceiving a research question, designing experiments, and finding results.&nbsp;</p>

Attending a Ruhlman Conference gives one insight into the type of research being conducted at Wellesley, but there is no central location where conference data can be explored and analyzed. This summer, I had the opportunity to participate in the Science Center Summer Research program and build an interactive website for the Ruhlman Conference. This interactive website allows users to explore Ruhlman Conference data through graphs and keyword searches. Through this experience, I learned design skills, how to adopt new software technologies quickly, and about the process of transforming an idea into a functional product. Beyond the experience of building the website for our community, I also learned how important it is to collaborate and learn from everyone.</span></p>

These are all catchphrases when discussing the present and future of financial firms, and all of them are technology driven. Majoring in both computer science and economics, I have always been fascinated with the intersection of technology and finance, and how they share an increasingly symbiotic relationship. This curiosity led me to internship in the Technology Division at Goldman Sachs this past summer, working in the group that develops for controllers (accountants). At this self-identified ‘technology’ firm, I learnt not only how to navigate technical problems, but also how technology is increasingly ‘disrupting’ the financial, and even the regulatory world. In this presentation, I will share my experiences as an intern and reflect on whether this is the answer in my quest to find a bridge between my two majors beyond Wellesley.</span></span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>&nbsp;The secretin receptor belongs to a class of surface proteins known as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are responsible for relaying chemical signals from a cell's environment to generate biological responses. GPCRs are implicated in a variety of physiological processes, from the transmission of sensory information to the regulation of blood sugar levels. As such, GPCRs are drug targets to approximately 30% of marketed pharmaceuticals today. Improved understanding of the secretin receptor's structure-function relationship is therefore crucial to generating and refining new treatment methods for a variety of human diseases. Working in Dr. Laurence J. Miller's lab on Mayo Clinic's Scottsdale campus, I applied the molecular biology techniques I acquired at Wellesley to study the human secretin receptor: honing my skills as a scientist and gaining a stronger understanding of the intersections between human health, industry, and academia.</p>

<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p dir="ltr"><span>This summer I worked as an Albright Fellow for the online education technology startup, Next Thought. Though the company is based in Norman, OK, I was offered the opportunity to do a “pioneer” internship with them in Jakarta, Indonesia. During this summer my colleague Egawati Panjei, who is native to Indonesia, and I worked in Jakarta together on a mixture of development, research, and marketing projects. My primary project was building an IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) provider tool. In simple terms an LTI provider is a technology that allows one online learning platform to connect with and share information with another online learning platform. During my summer I worked to create a basic LTI provider that would allow us to share students’ grades from our platform to another major online learning platform like Moodle or Open EdX. When I was not doing development work I was researching distance and online education in Indonesia as well as meeting with local professional educators to discuss the market for online education in Indonesia. </span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer, I participated in the Partnership Education Program in Woods Hole. Along with fourteen other students from across the country, I was introduced to the oceanographic and environmental sciences through coursework and research. Working in Dr. Amanda Spivak’s lab at the Oceanographic Institution, I researched salt marsh plant community response to restoration using percent cover, height, and biomass calculations. Overall, I learned more about what being a scientist would entail. Science is never quite as precise as I imagine, and data rarely comes out as expected. This is because our world and its beautiful ecosystems are extremely complex and variable. After this experience, I learned I love connecting field and lab work, and hope to further pursue these interests at Wellesley to apply them to a career. The greatest lesson I learned is every perceived roadblock is an opportunity to ask another question and pursue another branch of research.</p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I worked in an immunology lab at MD Anderson Cancer. I focused on an immunotherapy approach against multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer formed by malignant plasma cells found in the bone marrow, and specifically on how antitumor monoclonal antibodies could enhance cross-presentation of cellular antigens. I learned the basics of immunology and lab techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blots, ELISA assay, among others, that can be applied to any biology lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my introductory biology course at Wellesley, we discussed translational research to enhance human health. This experience taught me the importance of lab research in finding solutions to cure cancer; for instance, several of the antibodies that were made in the lab were being tested in clinical trials for application on multiple myeloma patients. I hope my audience will learn about the potential immunology has in curing cancer and the significance of research on improving medicine.</p>

<p><span>As a Taiwanese-American student who grew up in American culture, I never really experienced what it was like to live within the local Taiwanese community. Thus, I leaped upon the opportunity to intern at the Taiwan branch of Tomofun, an international pet technology startup. Although I have lived in Taiwan ever since I was nine years old, I surprisingly went through a reverse culture shock. Spending the summer at home in Taiwan while interacting with the local Taiwanese employees in the company lead me to strengthen my bond with my Taiwanese roots, yet it also prompted my American roots to loosen. Through my time at Tomofun, not only did I obtain skills and experience in Sales and Operations, but I also gained a perspective on my cultural identity.&nbsp; In this presentation, I will present on my experience working in an international startup and how it has changed my view of myself and Taiwan.&nbsp;</span></p>

Final Abstract:
</td>
<td bgcolor="#cccc99">
<p>This summer I worked as a research intern for The Hamilton Project, a part of the Brookings Institution which creates public policies designed to make the domestic economy work better for more people. To do this, The Hamilton Project not only produces original research on important features of the economy, but also brings together experts to create empirically driven policy proposals. Some examples of topics I worked on are prisoner reentry, occupational licensing, Head Start, and life expectancy. Being part of the research team helped me to understand how my economics coursework flows into the economic policy. I also saw both the power and limitations of economic research for creating social change. In my presentation, I will discuss the workings of The Hamilton Project, the policy issues on which I worked, and the major takeaways I have from this experience.&nbsp;</p>
